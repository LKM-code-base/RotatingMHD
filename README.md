# Rotating magnetohydrodynamic flow solver
The repository is meant to act as a source code control and back up of the project.

Milestones:
- [ ] Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
- [ ] Convective flow (Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with bouyancy term + heat equation)
- [ ] Rotational convective flow (Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with bouyancy term and coriolis term + heat equation)
- [ ] Rotational magnetohydrodynamic flow (Incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with bouyancy term and coriolis term + heat equation + induction equation )

which are to be tested with the following benchmarks
1. Taylor-Green Vortex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%E2%80%93Green_vortex and Schaefer et. al (1996)
1. Elman et. al (2011)
1. Christensen et. al (2000), Case 0
1. Christensen et. al (2000), Case 1 and Jackson et. al (2014)
